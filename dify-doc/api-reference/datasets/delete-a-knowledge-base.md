                API Key authentication. For all API requests, include your API
                Key in the `Authorization` HTTP Header, prefixed with 'Bearer '.
                Example: `Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}`. **Strongly recommend
                storing your API Key on the server-side, not shared or stored on
                the client-side, to avoid possible API-Key leakage that can lead
                to serious consequences.**
